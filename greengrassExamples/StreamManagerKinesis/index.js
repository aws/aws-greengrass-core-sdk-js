 * This example will create a Greengrass StreamManager stream called "SomeStream".
 * It will then start writing data into that stream and StreamManager will
 * automatically export the written data to a Kinesis Data Stream called "MyKinesisStream".
 * This example will run forever, until the program is killed.
 *
 * The size of the StreamManager stream on disk will not exceed the default (which is 256 MB).
 * Any data appended after the stream reaches the size limit, will continue to be appended, and
 * StreamManager will delete the oldest data until the total stream size is back under 256MB.
 * The Kinesis Data Stream in the cloud has no such bound, so all the data from this script
 * will be uploaded to Kinesis and you will be charged for that usage.
